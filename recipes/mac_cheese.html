		<h2 style="text-align:leftZ">What you'll need:</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>50g butter</li>
			<li>3 tbsp flour</li>
			<li>2 cups milk</li>
			<li>2 &frac12 cups water</li>
			<li>250g elbow macaroni</li>
			<li>&frac34 mozzarella cheese</li>
			<li>1 &frac12 cups cheese (Cheddar, Colby, or Gruyere)</li>
			<li>Salt and pepper</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Seasonings (Optional)</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>1 tsp garlic powder</li>
			<li>&frac12 tsp onion powder</li>
			<li>&frac12 tsp mustard powder</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>What to do:</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>Melt butter in a medium pot or large saucepan over medium heat. Add
				flour and cook for 1 minute.</li>
			<li>Add about 3/4 cup of milk and mix into butter mixture - it will become
				a slurry pretty quickly.</li>
			<li>Add remaining milk and mix so the slurry mixes in. Then add water and Seasonings.</li>
			<li>Add macaroni and mix. Stir occasionally as it comes to heat. When you
				see wisps of steam as you stir, lower the heat down to medium low.
			</li>
			<li>Stir regularly as it cooks for 9 - 10 minutes (it will bubble gently),
				or until the sauce thickens and the macaroni is just cooked - tender but
				still firm. It should still be saucy at this stage and thinner than you want.
			</li>
			<li>Take it off the stove and stir the cheese in quickly. Adjust salt and
				pepper to taste. <- In this step, the sauce thickens and reduces considerably.
			</li>
			<li>Serve immediately!!!</li>
		</ol>

			<h3 style="color:Orange;">Recipe Notes:</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>
					<p>
					I like to use a mix of mozzarella (because it melts so well) and some
					cheddar or tasty cheese for flavour. But you could just skip the mozzarella
					- I don't recommend using just mozzarella (not enough flavour).
					</p>
					<p>
						Other options: Gruyere, Colby, Monterey Jack, Pepper Jack, Provolone can
						be used in place of the cheddar.
					</p>
					<p>
						AUSTRALIA: Do not use Tasty Cheese! I have found that some brands can result in
						the sauce being a bit floury. Some are ok, some are not - safer to say don't use Tasty Cheese!
					</p>
				</li>

				<li>
					This recipe is pretty forgiving as long as you take it off the stove
					before the sauce reduces so much it disappears! The liquid to pasta
					ratio is such that by the time the liquid reduces down to make a sauce,
					the pasta is just cooked.
				</li>
				<li>
					I make my stovetop Mac and Cheese in one pot because I think it comes out
					better, using just the traditional ingredients. The reason is because the
					starch in the pasta releases into the sauce as it cooks, making it silky,
					glossy and it clings to the pasta. This is a technique used by Italians
					for all their pastas.
